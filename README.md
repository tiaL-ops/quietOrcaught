# ðŸŽ® Quiet or Caught

**Quiet or caught** is a stealth-based game where players must avoid being caught by sound-sensitive enemies. The game is currently in development, and I'm focused on learning and mastering the fundamentals of **Godot Engine**.

## ðŸš€ Development Status: Early Learning & Prototyping Phase

I'm currently working with **Godot Engine** using **GDScript** for scripting, managing assets like **PNG** and **SVG**, learning 2D physics, animations, and AI development (including sound detection mechanics), all while using **Git** for version control to develop a sound-based stealth game.

### What's Next:

- Introducing different sound levels based on player actions (e.g., walking, running).
- Expanding levels with sound-based challenges.
